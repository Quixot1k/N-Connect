# N-Connect

## Introduction

N-Connect, to connect Nintendo switch players

N-Connect is a platform for finding Nintendo switch players. We create this platform because in Nintendo Switch Systems, even if you added a stranger as a friend, there is no way you could contact her/him in the real world.

So if you added a friend in NS and want to have her/his contact so that you can have fun together, this platform is for you to search your friend's account. If she/he also registered before, you could chat with her/him directly!!!
